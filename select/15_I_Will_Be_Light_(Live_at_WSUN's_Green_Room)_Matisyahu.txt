Sit back and in these days
Remember my ways
Oh, will I get out of my cage?
Yes, I am a slave
Searching for some freedom
Searching for some freedom

So intend to sing them
Songs to spark, memories
What is a man with no history?
Where am I? Who am I?
What is this place?
We're just spinning in space

I will be light
I will be light
Oh, I will be light
Oh, I will be light

Time will continue without you
So in the end it's not about you
But what did you do?
Who do you love besides you, beside you?

Many died in the name of vanity
Many die in their mind's eye for justice
We die for you and still do
So I say to you this is nothing new

I will be light
I will be light
Oh, I will be light
Oh, I will be light

One tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
Burn away the darkness
You've got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine
To burn away the darkness

You've got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
To burn away the darkness
You've got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
To burn away the darkness

You've got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
To burn away the darkness
You've got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
To burn away the darkness
One tiny moment in time

I will be light
Oh, I will be light
Oh, I will be light
I will be light, light, light
I will be light, oh, oh, oh

I will be light
I will be light
I will be light now, oh la la la la
La-la-la-light, I will be light
