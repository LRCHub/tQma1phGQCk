Half of these niggas ain't
never seen shit and
these bitches ain't
seen shit either
When she rock out she rock
in her track suit
it's Balenciaga or Adidas
And this shit don't make
no sense how I went
from broke to rich
How the fuck you want me
now back then you act like
you ain't notice me
Now I got diamonds
now I got these jewels
Now these how comin in twos
Now my pockets filled with cash
Bitch I walk around
with them blues
Lil bitch I walk around
with them blues now
Yea you know how I'm rockin
Cut off stragglers
Keep Kush in my pocket
They treat my swag
just like door
The way these niggas knockin
Bitch I'm in that mode
like Naruto
Tell fox
I don't want that hoe
she ain't bringing
Nothing to the table but her box
I be tired of fukin
And I'm tired of being
tired shit fuck it
Everyday I ball out I make sure
I get a bucket
How the fuck you don't know
my middle name
But you claim that you love me
You don't love me
I know you don't love me
If a bitch try me
it's gon get real ugly
If she wanna leave I let her
leave she already fucked me
I'm such a Asshole
Money over everything
these niggas gon fold
Before my cash fold
Every time I post on Instagram
I make her mad oh
Every time I pop out you know
I'm with a bad hoe whoa
And you can't relate cause what
I been doing lately
feel so unreal
And I get depressed when I know
there's nobody feel how I feel
I was with Lil Killa tryna
catch a kill
I remember way way back
in the day
We couldn't even afford no meals
What I spend on purple drink
I could've paid your bills off
for a year
I was ubering everywhere
now it's 220 on my dash
when I steer
Half of these niggas ain't
never seen shit and
these bitches ain't
seen shit either
When she rock out she rock
in her track suit
it's Balenciaga or Adidas
And they say love can't
never ever be forever
So I'm taking advantage of
the moment
Bitch I'm at the top
I ain't got no Opps
I ain't got no opponents
When you at the top ain't
nobody there
It get real real lonely
Everybody said
this hoe ain't goin
Wait til I walk up on her
Man this shit don't make
no sense I'm rich
I was dead broke on the corner
And this shit don't make
no sense how I went
from broke to rich
How the fuck you want me
now back then you act like
you didn't notice me
Now I got diamonds
now I got these jewels
Now these hoes coming in twos
Now my pockets filled with cash
Bitch I walk around
with them blues
Lil bitch I walk around
with them blues now
Yea
Yea you know how I'm rockin
Cut off stragglers
Keep Kush in my pocket
They treat my swag
just like door
The way these niggas knockin
Bitch I'm in that mode
like Naruto
Tell fox
I don't want that hoe
she ain't bringing
Nothing to the table but her box
