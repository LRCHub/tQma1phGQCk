[00:10.22] The views just changed like a bad romance
[00:12.42] She'll be back like a boomerang
[00:14.74] I know I make sense for your fairy tale
[00:17.48] I can't be around, gotta wish you well
[00:36.48] 
[00:19.84] Always knew you'd find me
[00:29.38] Even when I run away
[00:34.05] Always knew you would
[00:39.15] Even when I run away
[00:49.15] 
[00:43.69] Mama, you sweet like mama
[00:47.49] You sweet like butter
[00:49.45] Miss venomous butter
[00:51.84] Need a dollar, I'm just tryna spend it on you
[00:56.61] Diamond too dizzy, get cool
[00:58.73] I'll be yours, except you want jewels
[01:17.23] 
[01:01.36] Kaleidoscope lenses covering the scenery
[01:07.75] Toke off your disguise, now you turned into a dancer
[01:12.45] Tryna make my mind up, keeping me all night
[01:17.21] Don't wanna answer questions if you already got the answers
[01:46.71] 
[01:22.66] Always knew you'd find me
[01:28.70] Even when I run away
[01:33.19] Always knew you would
[01:38.46] Even when I run away
[01:48.46] 
[01:42.78] You gon' make me act a fool, act a fool
[01:46.97] You gon' make me bust a move
[01:50.82] I just wanna fuck with you
[01:55.82] Baby, tell me what to do
